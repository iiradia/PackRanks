<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About
### The Problem
Course registration is a complicated and tedious process.

When students plan their courses for the upcoming semester, there are many important factors to consider. However, pertinent information is decentralized across many resources.

The universityâ€™s course planning software Penn InTouch is notoriously difficult to navigate and forces students to reference external tools. Penn Course Search addressed some of these shortcomings, but fell short on critical features and user friendliness.

Penn undergraduates need a more comprehensive and intuitive course planning tool to simplify the complicated course registration process.

### Solution
We built <a target="_blank" href="http://packranks.com/login">PackRanks</a>, a web app that allows students to find and plan their courses for the upcoming semester, combining a comprehensive course search with a meticulous email notification service to provide up-to-date and accurate information in a convenient and practical manner.

PackRanks aims to help students feel more informed and confident when choosing courses, while simultaneously aggregating an abundance of resources into a concise presentation.
